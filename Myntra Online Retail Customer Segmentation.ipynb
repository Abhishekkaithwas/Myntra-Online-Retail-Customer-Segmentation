What is/are the insight(s) found from the chart?"],"metadata":{"id":"22aHeOlLveiV"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Distribution of Individual Variables:\n","\n","Quantity: The histogram for 'Quantity' is likely to be right-skewed, indicating that most orders have relatively small quantities, while a few orders have very large quantities (potential bulk purchases or outliers). UnitPrice: The histogram for 'UnitPrice' might also be right-skewed, showing that most items have lower unit prices, with some higher-priced items. TotalPrice: The histogram for 'TotalPrice' would probably be similar to 'Quantity', right-skewed with most orders having lower total prices and a few having much higher total prices. Relationships between Variables:\n","\n","Quantity vs. TotalPrice: You should see a clear positive linear relationship in the scatter plot between 'Quantity' and 'TotalPrice'. As the quantity of items in an order increases, the total price of the order also increases, which aligns with the strong positive correlation we observed in the heatmap. UnitPrice vs. Quantity/TotalPrice: The scatter plots between 'UnitPrice' and 'Quantity', as well as 'UnitPrice' and 'TotalPrice', are likely to show a more scattered or random pattern, indicating a weak or no correlation, as we also saw in the heatmap. This suggests that the unit price of an item does not strongly influence the quantity purchased or the total price of the order. Potential Outliers: You might observe some outliers in the scatter plots, particularly for 'Quantity' and 'TotalPrice'. These outliers could represent bulk purchases, unusual transactions, or data errors. They should be investigated further to understand their nature. Business Implications and Actions\n","\n","Focus on Quantity-Based Promotions: Since 'Quantity' has a strong influence on 'TotalPrice', the business could implement promotions or strategies to encourage customers to purchase larger quantities. This could involve volume discounts, bundling products, or offering loyalty rewards for higher-quantity purchases. Pricing Flexibility: The weak relationship between 'UnitPrice' and 'TotalPrice' suggests that the business might have some flexibility in adjusting prices without significantly impacting sales. However, pricing strategies should still be carefully considered and aligned with overall business goals and customer expectations. Product Mix and Recommendations: The pair plot might reveal patterns in the relationship between 'UnitPrice' and 'Quantity' that could inform product mix and recommendation strategies. For example, if customers tend to purchase a mix of low-priced and high-priced items, the business could offer a variety of products at different price points and use data-driven recommendations to suggest complementary products regardless of their unit prices. Investigate Outliers: Outliers in the pair plot should be investigated to determine if they represent valid transactions or data errors. If they are errors, they should be corrected or removed from the dataset. If they are valid but unusual transactions, they might provide insights into specific customer segments or product categories."],"metadata":{"id":"uPQ8RGwHveiV"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## ***5.
